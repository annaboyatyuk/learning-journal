journal entry 1/17/18

learning html and css is great , its much simpler than javascript but maybe its because those are the tutorials that I did before starting school. so i probably just need more practice with that.

this week I have been listening to the lecture instead of typing along and it seems like i absorb the information much better because all the code is on the class github anyway, to refer back to.

its great that were practicing all the git stuff from the begining to get into the practice of all the commands.
