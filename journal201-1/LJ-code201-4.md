journal #4

1/23


I got behind on my reading and my journals and now im freaking out because i dont have time. ill just sleep less. no big deal.

last week the labs on the functions were much easier than the first week which was so great. and then i think i got too relaxed with all the free time i had.

it seems like salmon cookies wont be as bad as people have hyped it up to be.
