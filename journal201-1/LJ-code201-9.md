learning journal 2/7

today I learned that I shoudnt put things off until the next day because yesterday i was like its fine, I could sleep, Ill do my readings tomorrow. and I immediately regret this decision because I'll probably have to stay up too late today.


I also decided to drive in the silence because its my only time to think things through and solve problems.

I think that now that ive gotten used to the schedule im not as tired anymore. i dont have to drink so much coffee even though the past 2 weeks with salmon cookies were a lot more stressful.
