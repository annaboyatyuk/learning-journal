Learning journal 1/31


I have a hard time keeping up with the readings because I really want to read it carefully until I understand it but I dont have enough time for that so I've been trying to skim through the chapters but I hate doing that lol it doesn't make sense.

Its really exciting that my cookie table works lol I'm so proud of it.
