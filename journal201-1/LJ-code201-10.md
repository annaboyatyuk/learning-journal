2/11 learning journal

the busmall lab just has so many different requirements all at once

ive been having a lot of arguments with myself this week lol 
'i cant do this'
'yes i can'
'i dont know what im doing'
'its fine i can learn it'


ive also had to remind myself that i had 0 knowledge of any javascript in december and now i can do so much. so comparing myself to the past me is encouraging.
